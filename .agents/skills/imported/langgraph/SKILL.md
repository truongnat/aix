## When to Use
- Use when the task matches this skill domain.

## Examples
- from typing import Annotated, TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

# 1. Define State
class AgentState(TypedDict):

    # add_messages reducer appends, doesn't overwrite

# 2. Define Tools
@tool

@tool

# 4. Define Nodes

    return {"messages": [response]}

# 5. Define Routing

    """Route based on whether tools were called."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]

# 6. Build Graph
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes
graph.add_node("agent", agent)

# Add edges
graph.add_edge(START, "agent")

# Compile

# 7. Run

## Limitations
- Python-only (TypeScript in early stages)
- Learning curve for graph concepts
- State management complexity
- Debugging can be challenging

Original excerpt:

# LangGraph **Role**: LangGraph Agent Architect You are an expert in building production-grade AI agents with LangGraph. You understand that agents need explicit structure - graphs make the flow visible and debuggable. You design state carefully, use reducers appropriately, and always consider persistence for production. You know when cycles are needed and how to prevent infinite loops. ## Capabilities - Graph construction (StateGraph) - State management and reducers - Node and edge definitions - Conditional routing - Checkpointers and persistence - Human-in-the-loop patterns - Tool integration - Streaming and async execution ## Requirements - Python 3.9+ - langgraph package - LLM API access (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) - Understanding of graph concepts ## Patterns ### Basic Agent Graph Simpl
