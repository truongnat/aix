# writing-skills

## Purpose

Create or revise skills so they remain clear, bounded, validated, and consistent with the Harness Design System.

## Boundary

- This skill covers creating or improving reusable capability contracts.
- This skill does not cover importing a large skill catalog or creating one-off prompt notes.

## When To Use

- when adding a new skill
- when refining an existing skill
- when a skill is too vague, too broad, or too abstract
- when a future domain capability may need a distinct skill contract

## When Not To Use

- when the task does not involve skill authoring
- when only workflows or templates are changing
- when an existing skill or pack already covers the need with small edits

## Inputs

- [skills/SKILL_AUTHORING_RULES.md](../SKILL_AUTHORING_RULES.md)
- [docs/skill-system.md](../../docs/skill-system.md)
- [templates/SKILL.md](../../templates/SKILL.md)
- the existing skill or pack set

## Workflow

1. Check existing skills and packs first.
2. Decide whether the need is better handled by updating an existing skill, updating a pack, or adding a new skill.
3. Use `skills/SKILL_AUTHORING_RULES.md` to define metadata, contract, decision, execution, and quality.
4. Keep the skill compact and preserve the repository heading structure.
5. If a new required skill surface is added, update `bin/validate.js`.
6. Run `node bin/validate.js` and `npm test`.

## Operating Principles

- Prefer updating before adding.
- Skills should be single-purpose and distinct.
- Boundaries prevent misuse and overlap.
- Workflows should be actionable, not philosophical.
- Skills should plug cleanly into commands, workflows, templates, and gates.

## Output Contract

This skill must produce:

- an updated existing skill, pack, or a justified new skill
- preserved required headings for validated skills
- updated validation rules when new required repository files are introduced

## Common Failure Modes

- creating a new skill for a one-off task
- duplicating an existing skill with minor wording changes
- turning a skill into a long reference essay
- forgetting to update validation for newly required repository contracts

## Decision Rules

- Default: update an existing skill if the capability already exists.
- Add a new skill only if the need is recurring and distinct.
- Use a skill pack when the need is routing-oriented rather than deep capability-oriented.
- Escalate if the proposed skill overlaps heavily with an existing skill or would create catalog bloat.

## Verification Expectations

- `node bin/validate.js` passes
- `npm test` passes
- required headings remain intact
- the skill is compact and distinct from existing skills

## Checklist Before Done

- [ ] Existing skills and packs were checked first
- [ ] A new skill was added only if the need is recurring and distinct
- [ ] Required headings are present
- [ ] The skill is compact enough to be reused
- [ ] `bin/validate.js` was updated if required
- [ ] `node bin/validate.js` passed
- [ ] `npm test` passed

## Safety Notes

- Do not include credentials, tokens, customer data, or private business data.
